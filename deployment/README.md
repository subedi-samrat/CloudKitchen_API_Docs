## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm (v9 or later)
- PostgreSQL
- Git

## Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cloud-kitchen-api.git
   cd cloud-kitchen-api
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in the required environment variables (database connection, JWT secret, etc.)

## Database Setup
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running
2. Create a new database for the project
3. Run database migrations:
   ```
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

## Application Deployment
1. Build the application:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
2. Start the application:
   ```
   npm run start:prod
   ```

For cloud deployment, consider using platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku. Follow their respective deployment guides for NestJS applications.

## Scaling Considerations
- Implement load balancing for horizontal scaling
- Consider database replication for read-heavy operations
- Utilize caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data
- Optimize database queries and indexes

## Monitoring and Logging
- Set up application logging (e.g., Winston, Pino)
- Implement health check endpoints
- Use monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for system metrics
- Set up alerts for critical issues

## Security Measures
- Ensure all environment variables are properly set and secured
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Regularly update dependencies and apply security patches
- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks

## Troubleshooting
- Check application logs for errors
- Verify database connectivity
- Ensure all required environment variables are set
- Check for sufficient system resources (CPU, memory, disk space)
