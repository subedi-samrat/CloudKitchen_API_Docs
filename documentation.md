# Microservices-based eCommerce System Development Documentation

## Overview
This documentation outlines the architecture, technology stack, and development practices for a robust, scalable, and secure eCommerce system built using microservices. The system is designed to manage a large-scale online store that supports user authentication, product management, order processing, payment integration, shipping, and notifications. The architecture emphasizes flexibility, fault-tolerance, and ease of scalability.

---

## Architecture
The system follows a microservices-based architecture where each service performs a specific function. These services are independent, self-contained, and communicate with each other through well-defined APIs. The architecture ensures:

- Loose coupling between services.
- Independent deployment, scaling, and maintenance of each service.
- Fault tolerance and better management of failures.
- Ease of scaling individual services as required by the system load.

## Microservices
Each service has its own database and is independently deployed, allowing updates without affecting other services. Here are the core microservices:

1. **User Service**: Handles user registration, login, and profile management.
2. **Product Catalog Service**: Manages products, categories, and inventory.
3. **Order Service**: Processes and manages customer orders.
4. **Payment Service**: Integrates with third-party payment providers.
5. **Shipping Service**: Manages shipping details and tracks delivery status.
6. **Notification Service**: Sends notifications (email, SMS, push notifications).

---

## User Service
This microservice is responsible for user-related functionalities.

- **Features**:
  - User registration and login.
  - Password management (reset, update).
  - User profiles and session handling.
  - Role-based access control (admin, customer).

- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /users/register`: Register a new user.
  - `POST /users/login`: Authenticate a user.
  - `GET /users/profile`: Retrieve user profile data.
  - `PUT /users/update`: Update user profile.

---

## Product Catalog Service
Handles everything related to the product listings and inventory.

- **Features**:
  - Product creation, updating, and deletion.
  - Inventory management (real-time stock status).
  - Product categories, tags, and filtering.
  - Product reviews and ratings.

- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /products`: List all products.
  - `POST /products`: Add a new product (admin).
  - `PUT /products/:id`: Update product details (admin).
  - `DELETE /products/:id`: Delete a product (admin).

---

## Order Service
Processes customer orders and manages order statuses.

- **Features**:
  - Create new orders.
  - Update order status (pending, processing, shipped, delivered).
  - Manage returns and refunds.
  - Maintain order history for users.

- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /orders`: Place a new order.
  - `GET /orders/:id`: Retrieve order details.
  - `PUT /orders/:id/status`: Update order status (admin).

---

## Payment Service
Handles all payment processing through third-party providers like Stripe, PayPal, etc.

- **Features**:
  - Payment initiation and confirmation.
  - Integration with third-party payment gateways.
  - Handling of payment failures, refunds, and disputes.
  - Support for multiple payment methods (credit card, bank transfer).

- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /payment/checkout`: Initiate payment.
  - `GET /payment/status`: Check payment status.
  - `POST /payment/refund`: Initiate a refund.

---

## Shipping Service
Manages shipping logistics and delivery tracking.

- **Features**:
  - Integration with external shipping carriers (DHL, FedEx).
  - Calculate shipping costs.
  - Manage tracking numbers.
  - Update shipping status.

- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /shipping/calculate`: Calculate shipping cost.
  - `POST /shipping/track`: Track the shipping status of an order.

---

## Notification Service
Handles all user notifications, including email, SMS, and push notifications.

- **Features**:
  - Send order confirmations.
  - Notify users of order updates.
  - Push notifications for promotional offers.

- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /notifications/send`: Send a new notification.
  - `GET /notifications/history`: Retrieve notification history for a user.

---

## Communication Between Microservices
Services communicate using REST APIs for synchronous communication and event-driven messaging (Kafka or RabbitMQ) for asynchronous communication.

### Patterns Used:
- **Synchronous (HTTP/REST)**: API Gateway calls specific microservices (e.g., User Service, Product Catalog).
- **Asynchronous (Messaging)**: Event-driven architecture using Kafka for order events, payment status updates, etc.

---

## API Gateway
The API Gateway serves as the entry point to the system, routing requests to the appropriate microservices and managing concerns like authentication and rate limiting.

- **Features**:
  - Authentication and authorization.
  - Routing to appropriate microservices.
  - Load balancing and rate limiting.
  - API monitoring and metrics.

---

## Event-Driven Communication
An event-driven architecture ensures that services remain decoupled and can scale independently. Events such as "Order Placed," "Payment Completed," or "Shipping Updated" are published to an event stream and consumed by relevant microservices.

- **Message Broker**: Kafka or RabbitMQ.
- **Event Types**:
  - `OrderCreated`
  - `PaymentProcessed`
  - `ShippingUpdated`

---

## Database and Persistence
Each service manages its own database, following the **Database per Service** pattern.

- **User Service**: PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- **Product Catalog Service**: MongoDB (for handling product data).
- **Order Service**: PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- **Payment Service**: PostgreSQL (to maintain transaction history).
- **Shipping Service**: MongoDB or SQL-based database.
  
Using separate databases ensures scalability and service independence.

---

## Service Discovery
Service discovery ensures microservices can dynamically locate one another in the system. Tools such as **Consul** or **Eureka** are used for service registration and discovery.

---

## Deployment
Deployment is managed using **Docker** for containerization and **Kubernetes** for orchestration. Kubernetes handles scaling, load balancing, and fault tolerance.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI for continuous integration and delivery.
- **Deployment Models**: Blue-Green or Canary deployments.

---

## Security
Security best practices include:

- **Authentication**: Using JWT or OAuth2 for securing APIs.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) for admin and user segregation.
- **Data Encryption**: TLS/SSL encryption for all communication.
- **Security Testing**: Regular vulnerability scanning and patch management.
  
---

## Monitoring and Logging
A centralized logging and monitoring system helps in tracking system health and performance.

- **Logging**: Use the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for dashboards.
- **Tracing**: Jaeger or OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing.

---

## CI/CD Integration
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines ensure that code is tested, built, and deployed automatically.

- **Pipeline Tools**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI.
- **Stages**:
  - Code build.
  - Unit and integration testing.
  - Automated deployment to staging and production environments.

---

## Scalability and Best Practices
Key considerations for scalability:

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Use Kubernetes to horizontally scale microservices based on load.
- **Load Balancing**: Leverage NGINX or HAProxy for distributing requests.
- **Database Sharding**: Apply sharding techniques to handle large datasets.
- **Caching**: Use Redis for in-memory caching of frequently accessed data.
- **Failover and Redundancy**: Use replication and backup strategies for database and services.

By adhering to these guidelines, the system can handle high volumes of traffic, provide seamless user experience, and scale with growing demands.
